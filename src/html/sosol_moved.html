        <p>The prototype version of the Son of SUDA Online editing environment for the Perseids Project and the
        Perseus Digital Library has moved.</p>
        
        <p>The new location is <a href="http://sosol.perseids.org/sosol">http://sosol.perseids.org/sosol</a></p>
        
        <p>User data from this prototype environment (i.e. the one at sosol.perseus.tufts.edu) has
        been archived but not carried over automatically to the new location. If you had work in progress that you would like
        ported to the new Perseids site please email <a href="mailto:bridget.almas@tufts.edu">bridget.almas@tufts.edu</a>.</p>
